# Presentation 
A experimental course project for 3D model rendering 

# Informations
A project as part of the VISI201 course at Savoie Mont Blanc University in 2023. \
This code is the continuation of an previous project realised by Raphael Tournafond in 2017. \
Tutor : Colin Weill-Duflos 

# Run the code 
Only run the code in the file resterisation.py. \
You can change the parameters of the final algorithm to visualise other objects with different positions and colours. \
This algorithm will render an image in .ppm format. Make sure you can open this type of image format for viewing the 3D model.
